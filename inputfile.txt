Notes:
Make sure that properties 6,7,8 are real values as integer values will
give inaccurate results.
Dollar and Nile units for reactivity are the only units currently
accepted. Case sensitive.
Although not used in the program currently reactivity change is a
variable that could be used later for the purposes of a variable reactivity.
